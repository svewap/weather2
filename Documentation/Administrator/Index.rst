Update from 2.x to 2.0.4
************************

Because of a security patch of TYPO3 all of our weather2 scheduler tasks can not be unserialized anymore. For
you it is not possible anymore to delete, modify or start any task as you can not open scheduler module. Further
no task will be executed anymore by Cronjob.
Please visit Upgrade module of TYPO3 and execute our UpgradeWizard to update our tasks in DB.

Update from 1.x to 2.x
***********************

There are breaking changes if you´re updating weather2 from 1.x to 2.x.
This chapter is about how to fix those breaking changes.

    1. Update weather2 using composer or the extension manager.
    2. If you´re using composer you may need to disable and enable the extension using the extension manager or using the database analyzer to get the new database structure.
    3. Clear all caches.
    4. Open the scheduler module
    5. Edit all tasks from type :code:`Call openweathermap.org api`. Directly save them after the click on edit. You don´t need to change any fields inside here.
    6. Remove all tasks from type :code:`Get regions from Deutscher Wetterdienst`. They should have a red background because they no longer exist.
    7. Either create a `dwd weather cell record manually <Create warn cells manually_>`_ OR create a task from type `Get warn cell records from Deutscher Wetterdienst` set it as single and execute it one time.
    8. Edit all tasks from type `Get weather alerts from Deutscher Wetterdienst` and select the cities/locations you want to fetch. Then save those tasks.
    9. Edit all Plugins from list_type :code:`weather2_weatheralert` (Weather Alerts) and select the cities/locations you want to display. Also check out the new setting :code:`Show preliminary information`.
    10. Clear frontend caches.
